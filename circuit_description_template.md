# Circuit description template

## Description

A description of the circuits you are storing. 
Please include things such as:
- motivation ("what's the purpose of the circuits"), 
- what algorithms have been used to create them (e.g. these circuits represent quantum phase estimation on a trotterized Hamiltonian)
- what were the inputs used to create them (e.g. Hamiltonians, graphs, molecules, random)

## Contact info

Your name, organization and contact info.

## Files description

Please describe all the files you're storing and what's inside them.

## Software

- What software has been used to create these circuits? 
- What version of the software? (if not versioned, please provide at least name of the git repo and commit hash, even if it's private and others won't have access to it)
- If using python please store the output of the `pip freeze` command, to make sure we have all the versions of the packages that got involved in generating these circuits.
