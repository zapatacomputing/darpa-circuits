# darpa-circuits

This repository has been created to store circuit instances that would be useful for DARPA TA2 projects.

While adding new circuits please follow the procedure below:

- Create a new directory with the date (YYYY_MM_DD), name and short description, e.g.: 2022_04_11_Zapata_simple_trotter
- Copy circuit_description_template.md from the main directory into yours and fill it in with the details.
- All the circuits should be stored in QASM format
- If there's any additional files that you want to add (e.g. code for generation or loading the circuits), feel free to add it. 

If you want to add new people into this repository please ask either Michał Stęchły (michal.stechly@zapatacomputing.com) or Peter Johnson (peter@zapatacomputing.com)
