# Clifford + T circuits for QPE for Hydrogen chains of varying size for stress testing purposes

## Description

This directory contains Clifford + T circuits using the grid synth tool for compiling the arbitrary Z rotations.

These circuits are generated by constructing Hamiltonians of the hydrogen chains using pyscf and compiling the circuits using Trotter and gridsynth algorithms to generate Clifford+T circuits

The purpose of these circuits is that they generate a set of increasing-size circuits that can be used for stress testing subsequent fault-tolerant compilation tools such as jabalizer.

The Clifford + T circuits that are output can be input to Jabalizer and the outputs can be used to get (coarse) resource estimates.

## Files description

- `generating_script.py` - Python script used to generate the circuit.
- `requirements.txt` - file with all the transient dependencies used for generating the circuits
- `time_<T>_error_<E>.json` - circuits are saved as cirq json files with naming convention, where T represents the Hamiltonian simulation time and E is the Hamiltonian simulation trotter error.
